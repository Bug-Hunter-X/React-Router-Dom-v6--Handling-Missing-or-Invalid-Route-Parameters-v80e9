This repository demonstrates a common issue in React Router Dom v6: handling missing or incorrectly formatted route parameters. The `bug.js` file showcases the problem, where navigating to a route with missing or invalid parameters leads to an error or unexpected behavior. The `bugSolution.js` file provides a solution using optional chaining and input validation to gracefully handle these cases.
