In React Router Dom v6,  a common issue arises when navigating to a route that requires parameters but those parameters are missing or improperly formatted. This can lead to unexpected behavior, such as rendering a blank screen or triggering errors within the component. For instance, consider a route like `/users/:userId` where `userId` is expected.  If a user tries to access `/users` without specifying an ID or if the ID is not a valid format (e.g., contains non-numeric characters), an error could result, particularly if you're not using the `useParams` hook correctly within your component. The component might not render, leading to a blank screen or, worse, it might crash with an error that's not very obvious.
